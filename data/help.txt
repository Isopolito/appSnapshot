USAGE: run.sh MODE
MODE: -c, --create = creates a snapshot of apps
      -a, --apply  = apply snapshot, i.e. download apps and copy config
      -h, --help   = this

CONFIGURATION: 
    data/linuxConfig: Linux configuration file
    data/linuxAppData.json: JSON formatted file that contains the name of the apps,
        the commands to download them, and config file locations.

    data/winConfig: Windows configuration file
    data/winAppData.json: JSON formatted file that contains the name of the apps,
        the commands to download them, and config file locations.

    NOTE: multiple entries can exist in appData.json for the same program. This allows for different configuration
        directories to be used. Only supply 'installName' for one of them though, so the install only happens once.
